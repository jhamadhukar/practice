1) static constructor doesnot have access modifier
2) static constructor will fire first and instance constructor after that.
3) a static constructor must be parameterless that means one class should have only one static constructor.
4) static constructor cannot have an explicit 'this' or 'base' constructor call.
5) Static field initializers run in the order in which the fields are declared
6) A class can be marked static, indicating that it must be composed solely of static
members and cannot be subclassed
7) Finalizers are class-only methods that execute before the garbage collector reclaims
the memory for an unreferenced object.
8) A partial method consists of two parts: a definition and an implementation.Partial methods must be void and are implicitly private.
9) There are two ways to specify a base class with partial classes: a) Specify the (same) base class on each participant. b) Specify the base class on just one participant.
10) a partial method must be in a partial class or struct.
